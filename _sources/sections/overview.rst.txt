Overview
~~~~~~~~

``BeAR`` is an open-source computer program that can perform retrieval calculations for observational data of planetary atmospheres as well as brown dwarfs. It is the successor of the previous retrieval code ``HELIOS-r2`` (`Kitzmann et al. 2020 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890..174K>`_) that has been successfully applied for the characterisation of data from ground-based and space telescopes for a wide range of objects.

``BeAR`` is currently able to perform retrievals for emission, transmission, and secondary-eclipse spectra. It can use low to mid-resolution spectral data, as well as photometric data points. It has support for constant temperature and abundance profiles of atmospheric constituents but can also retrieve vertically-varying profiles if the observational data is good enough.
