Temperature profiles
====================

BeAR currently includes the following parametrisations for atmospheric
temperature-pressure profiles

  - Milne's solution
  
  - Guillot temperature profile
  
  - Isoprofile

  - Piecewise polynomials

  - Cubic b splines
  
Details on the implementation of the latter three parametrisations are 
discussed :ref:`here <sec:profile_parametrisations>`. 


Milne's solution
----------------

Milne's solution is a simple, analytic temperature profile that has
been derived for a self-luminous object with a grey atmosphere. 



Isoprofiles

Piecewise polynomials
---------------------

   

Cubic b splines
